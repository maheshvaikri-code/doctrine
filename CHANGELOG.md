Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) ·
Versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/) (0.x — doctrine under active development).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- `.Doctrine/README.md` skill-playbook count corrected (ten → fourteen).
- G4/G5 gate-labeling conflict resolved: `code-reviewer` subagent description
  now names the G4/G5 review fan-out (per `03-parallel-execution.md §4`)
  instead of implying security-reviewer and qa-engineer run at G4.
- `.Doctrine.md §8` artifact tree: retrospective filename aligned with the
  template (`retro/<date>-<slug>.md`); release-checklist filing path added
  (`docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`) and mirrored in the template header.
- `01-workflow.md` G1 exit clarified: the ADR set *is* the design document
  (no separate design-doc template exists by design).
- Severity labels in `templates/code-review-report.md` aligned to the
  bracketed form used by the role card and workflow (`[BLOCKER]` …).

### Removed
- Duplicate `.Doctrine/agents/` folder (byte-identical copy of
  `.claude/agents/`). Canonical location is `.claude/agents/`, as stated in
  `.Doctrine.md §11` and the README layout.

### Added
- `CLAUDE.md` bootstrap shipping the `@.Doctrine.md` import that `§11` and
  `adapters/AGENTS.md` instruct users to create.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file), `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` (LF-canonical,
  matching the pack-wide canonicalization rules).
- Doctrine version of record now tracked in the `.Doctrine.md` header.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- Baseline import of the Doctrine System as received: root operating system
  (`.Doctrine.md`), 14 role cards, 14 skill playbooks, 6 standards,
  7 templates, gated workflow G0–G7, role protocol, parallel-execution
  protocol, multi-agent adapters (AGENTS.md + overlays), 10 Claude Code
  subagents, and un-integrated add-on packs (FDE/floci, graphify+ponytail,
  doctrine-state-plane zips) preserved for history.
